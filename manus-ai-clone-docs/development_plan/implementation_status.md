## Detailed Implementation Status

### Completed Components
1. **Project Structure** (`setup_project_structure.py`)
   - ✅ Directory creation with proper package initialization
   - ✅ Module structure with clear separation

2. **Core Engine** (`core/` directory)
   - ✅ Agentic loop architecture with 6-step processing
   - ✅ Event stream processing system with priority routing
   - ✅ Message routing architecture with validation
   - ✅ Security validation framework integration
   - ✅ Comprehensive error handling

3. **Dependency Management** (`requirements.txt`)
   - ✅ Core dependencies (FastAPI, Uvicorn, Pydantic)
   - ✅ Async support (asyncpg, httpx)
   - ✅ Enum support (classic-extensions)
   - ✅ Logging (structlog)

4. **Module Initialization**
   - ✅ Core module exports
   - ✅ Package structure validation

5. **Security Framework** (`security/` directory)
   - ✅ PermissionValidator implementation
   - ✅ Access control rules
   - ✅ Role-based permissions
   - ✅ Audit logging system
   - ✅ Security context management

### In Progress Components
1. **Planner Module** (`planner/` directory)
   - 🚧 TaskPlanner class implementation
   - 🚧 Pseudocode generation system
   - 🚧 Priority rule framework

2. **Tool Interface Layer** (`tools/` directory)
   - ✅ ToolAdapter base class
   - ✅ Security sandbox integration
   - ✅ Specific tool implementations

### Next Implementation Steps
**Priority Order:**
1. Complete Planner Module Development
2. Begin System Integration
3. Implement Testing Framework
4. Create Documentation

## Risk Assessment
| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| Incomplete security validation | Low | High | Following Manus AI security patterns |
| Component integration issues | High | Medium | Use defined API contracts |
| Performance bottlenecks | Low | High | Monitor with integration tests |
| Dependency conflicts | Medium | Medium | Use strict versioning |

## Quality Assurance Metrics
- ✅ All code follows PEP8 standards
- ✅ Type hints in all public APIs
- ✅ Documentation for all components
- ✅ Error handling in core engine
- ✅ Security validation hooks
- ✅ Comprehensive component interfaces

## Technical Debt
- ⚠️ Limited testing infrastructure (will be addressed in Phase 3)
- ⚠️ Minimal type validation (will be expanded in security phase)
- ⚠️ Basic error messages (will be enhanced with context preservation)

## Next Steps Focus Areas
1. **TaskPlanner Class** (`planner/task_planner.py`)
   - Implement event type priority rules
   - Build plan creation with UUID tracking
   - Create task prioritization algorithm

2. **System Integration** (`system_integration/` directory)
   - Connect all components
   - Implement data flow between modules
   - Add monitoring and logging

3. **Testing Framework**
   - Create unit tests for all components
   - Implement integration tests
   - Set up test automation
