# Manus AI Clone System Architecture

## Agentic Architecture Overview
This implementation follows the Manus AI agent loop structure while extending capabilities:
1. **Analyze Events**: Comprehensive event stream processing
2. **Select Tools**: Intelligent tool selection based on task requirements
3. **Wait for Execution**: Execution monitoring and result handling
4. **Iterate**: Continuous improvement through feedback loops
5. **Submit Results**: Structured result delivery with attachments
6. **Enter Standby**: Resource-efficient idle state management

## Core Components
### 1. Event Stream Processor
- Handles all event types (Message, Action, Observation, Plan, Knowledge, Datasource)
- Implements priority-based event routing
- Maintains historical context
- Filters system-generated events from user view

### 2. Planner Module
- Generates numbered pseudocode for task execution
- Tracks current step status and reflection
- Updates plans dynamically based on execution results
- Maintains plan history for learning purposes

### 3. Knowledge Module
- Stores and applies best practices
- Manages prompt engineering guidelines
- Maintains coding standards and patterns
- Tracks error handling strategies

### 4. Datasource Module
- Integrates with authoritative data APIs
- Enforces proper API usage patterns
- Manages authentication and rate limiting
- Optimizes data retrieval efficiency

### 5. Tool Interface Layer
- Implements Manus tool use rules
- Provides secure sandboxing
- Manages tool dependencies
- Handles input/output transformation

## System Design Principles
1. **Modular Architecture**: Clear component boundaries with defined interfaces
2. **Security First**: Sandboxing and permission controls at every layer
3. **Observability**: Comprehensive logging and monitoring
4. **Extensibility**: Plug-and-play architecture for new capabilities
5. **User-Centric**: Intuitive interface with detailed progress reporting
